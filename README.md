# BoSCO

Description
-----------
BoSCO is an open source project developed by faculty at UMR that helps instructors select, filter and represent different kinds of student data that should immediately inform them of the success of student performance and course delivery.
BoSCO runs on the browser, rather than an intensive statistical analysis package it is intended to be a light weight student data browser for "hypothesis generation". We would like to know if other instructors or departments are interested in using it. It is released here under "Creative Commons - Attribution Share Alike 3.0".
