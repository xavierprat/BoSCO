<h3>This is an old document that we wrote when trying to design bosco</h3>
<p>Important:
<b>
<ul>
	<li>The plots shown here are all fake numbers taken from a random function in excel. <a href="sampleData.xlsx">Take a look here</a></li>
	<li>Any of the student data represented could be filtered based on categorical variables (gender, ethnicity, have taken a course...)
	numerical (GPA, ACT, grade on a specific course or assignment</li>
	<li>This interface is designed to easily navigate and find interesting data. 
		<br>It will not include many graphing tools nor statistical analysis that do not reveal extra information. 
		<br>All data can be downloaded into csv form for further analysis and representation
		<br>We will use JSON data with a javascript database to easily navigate the so many different ways one can classify the data.
		<br>It will also be easy to allow users to upload their own data and/or interface it with iSEAL, Moodle...
	</li>
</ul>
</b></p>

<p>Possible Representations:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Course vs Course: matching students (paired samples).
		<ul>
			<li>How do students perform in one course vs another?
				<br>Compare final grade vs final grade or a specific assignment from courseI to another assignment form courseII
				<br>Example <img width="650" src="images/cvc.png"/>
			</li>
			<li>It cannot be the same course in different years because only the common students between the courses
				will be represented.
			    <br>BoSCO will find all students who took those two courses. 
				<br>Potentially, it can merge different semesters when different students may have taken that same course at a different time </li>
			<li>It can represent a final grade of a course vs an assignment grade of that same course since the students are the same
				<br><img src="images/cvc_hwvsfinal.png" width="650"/></li>

		</ul> 
	</li>
	<li>Course vs Time
		<ul>
			<li>How final (averaged over students) grades (or final letter) evolve over time (by semesters)
				<br><img src="images/cvt_average.png" width="650"/>
			</li>
			<li>Select as many courses as you want: Merge courses in one single average (e.g. clusters) or represent them as different lines
				<br><img src="images/cvt_cluster.png" width="650" />
			</li>
			<li>To find out how courses can be clustered based on similar grades go to the "Curriculum" section</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Students vs Time
		<ul>
			<li>Average grades for all courses taken by Freshmen, Sophomores, Juniors...
				<br><img src="images/svt_byyear.png" width="650" /></li>
			<li>Average GPA (all courses) or a  set of courses through time of one student, or filtered students
				<br><img src="images/svt_gpa.png" width="650"/></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Curriculum
		<ul>
			<li>Course vs Course: similarity between two un-matched (unpaired) samples
				<ul>
					<li>Robb's graphs from "R" were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient">Pearson correlation coefficient</a>
						<br>Can it only be applied with "matched" samples, that is, it needs common students between courses?
					</li>
					<li>Covariance, Student's t-test, chi-squared test, PCA, clustering analysis... 
						<br>if it has to be implemented we may need to choose which technique should be on BoSCO and which can be done elsewhere after downloading the data
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Sequence of courses that students choose: identify paths</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
Each student will have two kinds of variables:
<ul>
	<li>Measuring/Performance student variables:
		<br>These variables are associated to student's habilities: generally, except for surveys, the higher the better.
		<ul>
			<li>Course grades: final numerical, letter, N/S,  assignment grades (quizzes, papers...)</li>
			<li>GPA or average of cluster courses (computed on the fly or searchable)</li>
			<li>Student background - numerical: ACT scores</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Independent student variables:
		<ul>
			<li>Student background - non numerical: gender, ethnicity, first generation...</li>
			<li>Student while at UMR: number of credits, year he/she is in</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
Each course will have the following variables associated to it:
<ul>
	<li>Semester-->clasroom where it was taught, number of students, instructors, </li>
	<li>Do we need? pre-req, number of credits</li>
</ul>

<p>On tags and concepts:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Course vs Course representations: For integration purposes: 
		<ul>
			<li>Automatic search (NLP) or pulling out tags:<br>
			When clicking on a course object (semester, assignment...modules? LOs?)
			a series of tags will appear. When clicking on one of these a list of course object
			that have the tag will show up.
			</li>
			<li>UMR learning outcomes will be listed: upon clicking one of them
			a list of course objects that have the LOutcome will show up	
				</li>
			<li>MCAT (other standard of topics) are listed and on clicking
			a list of course objects that have the topic will show up	
			</li>
			<li>The same can be applied on standard (agreed) tags regarding:
				<ul>
					<li>Kinds of activities (group, preentation, writing)</li>
					<li>Cognitive level</li>
					<li>Math level</li>
					<li>For writing assignemnts: Literature's rubric</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>For quantifying concepts/topics instead of assignments: 
		<ul>
			<li>Choose one category: (math level,cognitive level)" and see the grade </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
